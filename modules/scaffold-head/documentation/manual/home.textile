h1. scaffold

scaffold (http://github.com/lmcalpin/Play--Scaffold) generates simple scaffolding code from your models.

h2. Getting Started

To include scaffold in an existing project add the following lines to your **conf/application.conf** file

bc. module.scaffold=${play.path}/modules/scaffold-head

h2. Using scaffold

Simply define your models as you would normally.  Scaffold supports standard Play! JPA entities as well as Siena.  Once you have defined your models, run:

bc. play scaffold:gen

to generate controllers and views.  By default, scaffold will not overwrite files that already exist.  You can use the --overwrite command to force scaffold to overwrite existing files.
